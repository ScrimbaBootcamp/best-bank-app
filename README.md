# Best Bank - Group Project

Note: this project is available in the "public space" and has been designed for **Scrimba Bootcamp** students.

**Best Bank** was originally created by *Rafid Hoda* as a [solo-project](https://scrimba.com/scrim/cocf84a259acc922196ded766)  for **Scrimba Frontend Developer** Module 4.

The *Group Project* version of **Best Bank** will extend the solo-project requirements to include more features.

The intent of this group project is to provide a *mentored experience* with developing a new **React Web App**.

Students with *basic React skills* can form their own group of 2-4 and then meet online to review the project.

## Quick start:
If you're keen to look at the starter code then you can download this repo and install it on your computer.

The suggested setup is with Vite.  Head over to [https://vitejs.dev/](https://vitejs.dev/) to learn more.
```
$ npm install
$ npm start
````

## Steps to Begin this *Scrimba Bootcamp* Group Project:
1. Form a group of 2-4 Bootcamp students, all of whom have completed all or most sections of Scrimba's ***React Basics*** module.
2. Find a convenient time to meet online to discuss your ideas for extending the initial requirements for the *Best Bank* project.
3. Before the meeting, group members should research some online banking apps, noting any UI layouts and features you like. 
4. During your group meeting, create a list of *all* the UI layout improvements you might make and new features you could add.
5. Next, decide which layout and feature improvements should be included *ASAP* and which ones can be postponed until later.
6. Then work together (sharing an online file?) to create a **Project Planning** document that includes what you've decided so far.
7. Finally, use the *Scrimba Bootcamp Discord Channel* to send the link to your **Project Planning** doc to *Bootcamp Mentor*... 'Paul'.

***NOTE***: this is an "*open-ended*" project... so your group will decide what, and how many, new features will be added to your project.
