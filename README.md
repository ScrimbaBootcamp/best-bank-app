# Best Bank - Group React Project
This project will begin with, and then extend, the Module 4 *Best Bank* [Solo-Project](https://scrimba.com/scrim/cocf84a259acc922196ded766) created by Rafid Hoda.

This repo includes all the starter files, provided by Rafid, to begin work on the Module 4 *Best Bank app*.

## Quick start:
If you're keen to look at the starter code then you can download a copy and install it on your computer.

The suggested setup is with Vite.  Head over to [https://vitejs.dev/](https://vitejs.dev/) to learn more.
```
$ npm install
$ npm start

## Group Instructions:
1. Form a group of 2-4 Bootcamp students, all of whom have completed all or most sections of Scrimba's *React Basics* module.
2. Then agree to a convenient time and meet online to discuss the requirements and stretch goals for the *Best Bank* solo project.
3. As part of you discussion, you could create a list of potential features and/or improvements that could be added now or later.
4. If you're going to start with *only* building the app based on the solo project's requirements and stretch goals, then proceed.
5. When you're ready to add new features and/or pages, and you want some feedback from a Bootcamp Mentor, please message *Paul*.

Remember, this is an open-ended project so your group will decide how many new features to add and in what order to add them.

For a Minimum Viable Product, your first version could be the Home page based on the [Solo-Project](https://scrimba.com/scrim/cocf84a259acc922196ded766) requirements and stretch goals.
